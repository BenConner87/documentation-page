                <p>Hangboard training works best inside a larger training program that includes climbing time as well as time spent improving your general fitness and endurance. Here are some things to consider as you start your training:</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have a goal in mind or a project you want to send. Think about grips and hand positions you are struggling with.</li>
                        <li>Keep it simple to start.</li>
                        <li>Take at least a full day or two to rest between hangboard training sessions to avoid straining your hands and tendons.</li>
                        <li>Remember that you are constantly working on finger strength when you are climbing in the gym or at the crag, so consider limiting your hangboard training sessions to three or four weeks—or until you feel like you are able to complete the project you had in mind.</li>
                        <li>Listen to your body. If anything feels weird, respect that.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Jug: These are the easiest holds and are great for warming up. There’s not much to them. Get your hand around them and hang in a comfortable position.</li>
                        <li>Slopers: Get as much of your hand on the hold as possible and push down on it.</li>
                        <li>Pockets: You can vary the intensity by using one to four fingers in the holes as well as train with different sets of fingers out of the hold. For example, you could hold with your pointer, middle and ring fingers in the hold or train with your middle, ring and pinky in the hold. Remember, your middle finger is the strongest. Try to keep your hand open, avoiding curling your fingers into a crimp.</li>
                        <li>Pinches: If your hangboard has pinch holds, grip the hold with your thumb on one side and your fingers on the other. Wider pinches are harder. As an alternative, use a pinch block, which is a basic block (made of wood, polyurethane or other materials) from which you hang weights; train your pinch grip using different widths.</li>
                        <li>Edges: Edges range from deep to really shallow (more difficult). Use an open hand position. Imagine slapping your hand against a window and slowly dragging it down so your fingertips are on the edge. Don’t close your thumb over your index fingers (as in a full crimp).</li>

                <br>
                    <p>Minimum Edge Hangs: Based on research by Eva Lopez-Rivera, this protocol is what I recommend as an entry-level hangboard program (not to be confused with a "beginner’s” program—true beginners shouldn't hangboard train). A few multi-week cycles will bring noticeable gains in finger strength for intermediate climbers, as well as serve as preparation for delving into weighted fingerboard hangs (detailed below). Initially, you will need to do some experimental hangs on different-size edges and pockets to identify what features you can hang on for about 15 seconds before grip failure. Actual training hangs should terminate a few seconds before failure, so I recommend making each hang exactly 12 seconds in length. By design, this training protocol will produce little or no muscle pump as it primarily targets the anaerobic alactic energy system. As you gain strength, keep your hangboard training progressive by using smaller holds or fewer fingers. Really strong climbers may be able to hang on holds as small as 8mm or even 6mm. Though painful, these tiny-edge hangs may increase “pulp”—the fleshy tip of your fingers that, like sticky rubber shoe soles, deforms over small rock holds to provide grip!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Maximum Weight 10sec Protocol: As you gain strength from doing the minimum-edge protocol explained above, you’ll eventually come to the point of needing to train on some really small holds that hurt and, perhaps, tempt “dry-firing” (explosively slipping off the finger hold) or injury. It’s at this time (if not sooner) that you should switch to one of the two maximum-weight protocols detailed here. The beauty of “max hang” protocols is that you increase intensity by adding weight rather than using smaller holds—this makes for less skin pain and little risk of dry-firing. The ideal size edge for weighted hangs is around three-quarters the length of your first finger pad (index finger). If you’re new to weighted hangs I recommend using a hold between 20mm and 23mm. In the future, you may find that training on a 14mm edge with less weight added is the way to go. Experiment! While some folks employ a weight belt or vest to add resistance, I recommend investing in a few free weight plates and a loading pin that you can hang from the belay loop of your harness. This makes it super easy to unclip the weights and de-load between hangs. Buy a loading pin and cheap free weight plates on Craigslist.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Maximum Weight 7/53 Protocol: This is an advanced maximum-weight protocol that I created to train maximum strength and foster more aerobic power (by stressing the muscles to increase the rate of CP resynthesis during the 53-second rest between maximal hangs). It’s also a very time efficient protocol for elite climbers doing multiple sets. This is my favorite finger-strength protocol!</p>

                <p>Repeater 10/5: If you’ve got sweaty hands that require frequent chalking, then this is the Repeater protocol for you! It will provide virtually the same training stimulus (i.e. time under tension is 40 seconds per set rather than 42 seconds) and benefits as the 7/3 protocol described above. However, the 5-second rest between hangs is just enough for a quick dip of chalk!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Repeater 7/3: This is the go-to Repeater training protocol for top route-climbers around the world! You’ll want to use a timing App to be precise with the 7/3 hang-rest intervals. Keep it crisp—no cheating and no chalking up between hangs. (No, you can’t chalk up in 3 seconds—this is only enough time for a quick shake. If you have sweaty hands that require chalk between hangs, then use the 10/5 protocol below.)</p>

                <p>What’s better, a hangboard made of wood or molded plastic?
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>If you tend to have sweaty fingers, then the texture modeled into a plastic board may be a plus. However, extensive training with added weight tends to be more comfortable on a wooden hangboard. Ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference. Some climbers purchase a few different hangboards in order to vary grip types and texture as needed from session to session.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                </p>

                <p>What is the proper arm, shoulder, and torso positioning for safe and effective hangboarding?
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>No matter the fingerboard protocol you choose, it’s essential to train with good technique!  Maintain muscular tension throughout your shoulders and upper torso by engaging your scapular stabilizers and rotator cuff—think "shoulders down, chest out". Never hangboard train with relaxed/passive shoulders and a hollowed chest! Lift your knees only slightly to develop necessary core stiffness, and never train with the full-crimp grip (i.e. “closed crimp” with thumb lock). Also important: engage in twice-weekly training of the scapular stabilizers and rotator cuff muscles—consult Training For Climbing for comprehensive instruction on antagonist, stabilizer, and forearm flexor muscle training....and a whole lot more!</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>How can I best nourish my tendons and muscles to gain strength, accelerate recovery, and reduce injury risk?
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>Research has shown distinct nutritional protocols to support tendon health, connective tissue recovery, and strength/power gains! Consuming vitamin C-enriched hydrolyzed collagen before targeted training is the lynchpin of the protocol shown to double collagen synthesis after exercise. This is revolutionary information for a hard-training climber wanting to develop stronger, more injury-resistant tendons and ligaments/pulleys! Furthermore, post-workout consumption of Leucine-rich protein has been shown to amplify mTOR signaling and muscle protein synthesis. Whey protein isolate is the best protein supplement for climbers, given its ultra-clean, low-calorie, and high-leucine characteristics. Vegan athletes can best support tendon and muscles recovery with Powerplex plant-based protein.</li>
